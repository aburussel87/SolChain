# SolChain Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing strategy for SolChain prototype covering all system components.

## Testing Structure

### 1. Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
- **Frontend**: Component testing, service testing
- **Backend**: Controller testing, model testing, service testing
- **Smart Contracts**: Contract function testing, edge cases
- **IoT Simulator**: Device simulation testing
- **AI/ML**: Model accuracy testing, prediction validation

### 2. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- **API Integration**: End-to-end API testing
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contract interaction testing
- **Database Integration**: Data persistence testing
- **IoT Integration**: Device communication testing
- **AI Integration**: Model serving and inference testing

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
- **User Workflows**: Complete user journey testing
- **Trading Scenarios**: P2P energy trading flows
- **Payment Flows**: Token transactions and fiat conversion
- **Emergency Scenarios**: System failure and recovery
