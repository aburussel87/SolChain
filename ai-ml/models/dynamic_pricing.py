"""
Dynamic Pricing Model

AI model for real-time energy pricing based on supply, demand, and market conditions

Functions to implement:
- DynamicPricingModel(): Initialize pricing model
- train_model(): Train pricing model with historical data
- predict_price(): Predict optimal energy price
- update_model(): Update model with new data
- calculate_base_price(): Calculate base energy price
- apply_demand_multiplier(): Apply demand-based pricing
- apply_supply_multiplier(): Apply supply-based pricing
- consider_weather_impact(): Factor weather impact on pricing
- apply_time_of_day_pricing(): Apply time-based pricing
- calculate_grid_premium(): Calculate grid connection premium
- implement_congestion_pricing(): Implement network congestion pricing
- optimize_market_maker(): Optimize automated market making
- detect_price_manipulation(): Detect price manipulation attempts
- validate_price_bounds(): Validate price within acceptable bounds
- generate_pricing_insights(): Generate pricing analytics
- export_pricing_data(): Export pricing data and predictions

Model Architecture:
- Feature Engineering: Supply/demand ratios, weather data, time features
- Model Types: LSTM for time series, XGBoost for feature-based prediction
- Input Features: Production, consumption, weather, grid status, market depth
- Output: Optimal price per kWh in SolarTokens
