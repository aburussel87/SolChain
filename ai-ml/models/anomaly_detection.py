Functions to implement:
- AnomalyDetectionModel(): Initialize anomaly detection
- train_anomaly_detector(): Train anomaly detection model
- detect_energy_theft(): Detect energy theft attempts
- detect_meter_tampering(): Detect smart meter tampering
- detect_trading_anomalies(): Detect unusual trading patterns
- detect_system_failures(): Detect system component failures
- analyze_consumption_patterns(): Analyze normal consumption patterns
- flag_suspicious_transactions(): Flag suspicious blockchain transactions
- detect_price_manipulation(): Detect market price manipulation
- monitor_device_health(): Monitor IoT device health anomalies
- detect_network_attacks(): Detect cybersecurity attacks
- analyze_behavioral_patterns(): Analyze user behavioral patterns
- generate_anomaly_scores(): Generate anomaly confidence scores
- create_alert_system(): Create real-time alert system
- investigate_anomalies(): Automated anomaly investigation
- export_anomaly_reports(): Export anomaly detection reports

Model Architecture:
- Unsupervised Learning: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders
- Statistical Methods: Z-score analysis, moving averages, control charts
- Time Series Analysis: Seasonal decomposition, trend analysis
- Input Features: Energy data, transaction patterns, device metrics
- Output: Anomaly scores and classification (normal/suspicious/critical)
