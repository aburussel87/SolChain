# SolChain Economic Model

## Token Economics Overview
The SolarToken (SOLAR) serves as the native currency for the SolChain ecosystem, facilitating:
- Energy trading transactions
- Network security through staking
- Governance participation
- Incentive distribution

## Supply Mechanics
- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000,000 SOLAR tokens
- **Inflation Rate**: 3% annually (distributed as staking rewards)
- **Burn Mechanism**: 0.1% of transaction fees permanently burned
- **Maximum Supply**: Dynamically adjusted based on network growth

## Pricing Mechanisms
### Dynamic Pricing Algorithm
The platform employs multi-objective optimization for price discovery:
```python
def calculate_optimal_price(supply, demand, grid_conditions):
    base_price = calculate_marginal_cost(supply)
    demand_multiplier = calculate_demand_pressure(demand)
    grid_stability_factor = assess_grid_conditions(grid_conditions)
    
    optimal_price = base_price * demand_multiplier * grid_stability_factor
    return constrain_price(optimal_price, min_price=0.05, max_price=0.50)
```

### Market Maker Incentives
- Liquidity providers receive 0.05% of trading volume

- Geographic expansion incentives for new regions

        self.stake = stake_amount
        self.reputation = reputation_score
        self.selection_probability = self.calculate_probability()
    
    def calculate_probability(self):
        # Combines stake amount and reputation for fair validator selection
        stake_weight = self.stake / total_network_stake * 0.7
        reputation_weight = self.reputation / max_reputation * 0.3
        return stake_weight + reputation_weight
    
    def validate_block(self, block):
        # Block validation logic
