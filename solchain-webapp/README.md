## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:

- **Frontend**: The user interface of the application, built with React. It includes components for dashboards, trading, and wallet management.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic, including controllers, models, and services that handle authentication, energy management, trading, and blockchain interactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: The blockchain contracts that define the rules for energy trading and token management.
- **Mobile App**: A mobile application that allows users to interact with the SolChain platform on the go.
- **AI Services**: Machine learning models for demand forecasting, pricing optimization, and anomaly detection.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Web3.js, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **AI**: Python, Machine Learning Libraries
- **Mobile**: React Native
