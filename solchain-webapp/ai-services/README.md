# AI Services for SolChain

The AI Services module of SolChain is designed to enhance the functionality of the blockchain-based P2P solar energy sharing microgrid system. This module leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize energy trading, forecast demand, and detect anomalies in energy usage.

## Components

1. **Models**: 
   - **Demand Forecasting**: Utilizes historical data and machine learning techniques to predict future energy demand, helping to balance supply and demand effectively.
   - **Pricing Optimization**: Implements algorithms to determine optimal pricing strategies for energy trading, ensuring fair and competitive rates for users.
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Monitors energy usage patterns to identify unusual behaviors that may indicate issues such as theft or equipment malfunction.

2. **API**: 
   - The `ml_api.py` file exposes endpoints for interacting with the AI models, allowing the frontend and backend to access AI functionalities seamlessly.

3. **Utilities**: 
   - The `data_processing.py` file contains helper functions for preparing and processing data before it is fed into the AI models, ensuring data quality and consistency.

## Usage

To utilize the AI services, ensure that the required dependencies are installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` file. The AI services can be integrated with the main SolChain application to provide enhanced features such as real-time demand forecasting and automated pricing adjustments.

## Future Enhancements

Future iterations of the AI Services module may include:
- Advanced machine learning techniques for improved accuracy in predictions.
- Integration with IoT devices for real-time data collection and analysis.
- User feedback mechanisms to refine AI models based on actual usage patterns.

This module plays a crucial role in making SolChain a robust and intelligent platform for decentralized energy trading.
